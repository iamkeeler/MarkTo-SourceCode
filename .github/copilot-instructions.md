# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name
**MarkToRTF**

## Overview
MarkToRTF is a lightweight macOS application designed for users who frequently work with Markdown and need a quick way to convert it to Rich Text Format (RTF). The app will provide a simple, modern, and efficient user experience, leveraging a cross-platform framework to ensure maintainability and scalability.

## Key Features

1. **Markdown Input Window**
   - A resizable window where users can paste or type Markdown text.
   - Real-time syntax highlighting for Markdown.
   - Minimalistic and distraction-free design.

2. **Export to RTF**
   - A button within the window that:
     - Converts the Markdown content to RTF.
     - Copies the RTF content to the clipboard.
   - Uses a robust Markdown-to-RTF conversion library to ensure accurate formatting.

3. **Menu Bar Integration**
   - A menu bar icon that:
     - Displays a dropdown window for the Markdown input when clicked.
     - Allows users to quickly access the app without opening a separate window.
   - Option to pin the window for extended use.

4. **Performance**
   - Minimal CPU and memory usage when idle.
   - Efficient resource management to ensure smooth operation.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform
- **Primary Target**: macOS
- **Framework**: Use a cross-platform framework like **Electron** (JavaScript/TypeScript) or **Flutter** (Dart) to allow potential expansion to other platforms in the future.

### Architecture
- **Pattern**: Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
  - **Model**: Handles data and business logic (Markdown parsing and RTF conversion).
  - **View**: UI components (Markdown input window, menu bar dropdown).
  - **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between the Model and View, ensuring separation of concerns.

### Dependencies
- **Markdown Parsing**: Use a library like `markdown-it` (JavaScript) or `markdown` (Dart).
- **RTF Conversion**: Implement or integrate a lightweight library for Markdown-to-RTF conversion.
- **Clipboard Access**: Use platform-specific APIs for clipboard operations.

### Modern Standards
- Follow macOS Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) for UI/UX.
- Ensure the app is sandboxed for security.
- Use asynchronous programming to avoid blocking the UI thread.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - The app should consume less than 1% CPU when idle.
   - The Markdown-to-RTF conversion should complete in under 100ms for typical input sizes.

2. **Scalability**
   - Codebase should be modular to allow future feature additions (e.g., exporting to other formats).

3. **Maintainability**
   - Avoid code duplication by reusing functions and methods.
   - Write unit tests for core functionalities (Markdown parsing, RTF conversion).

4. **Accessibility**
   - Support macOS accessibility features like VoiceOver.
   - Provide keyboard shortcuts for common actions.

5. **Localization**
   - Ensure the app can be easily localized for different languages.

## User Stories

1. **Markdown Input**
   - As a user, I want to paste or type Markdown into a window so that I can prepare content for conversion.

2. **RTF Export**
   - As a user, I want to click a button to convert my Markdown to RTF and copy it to the clipboard so that I can use it in other applications.

3. **Quick Access**
   - As a user, I want to access the app from the menu bar so that I can quickly convert Markdown without opening a separate app.

4. **Low Resource Usage**
   - As a user, I want the app to use minimal system resources when not in use so that it doesn’t affect my system’s performance.

## Milestones

1. **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**
   - Markdown input window with syntax highlighting.
   - Button to convert Markdown to RTF and copy to clipboard.
   - Menu bar integration with dropdown window.

2. **Post-MVP**
   - Add settings for customization (e.g., font size, theme).
   - Support exporting to other formats (e.g., PDF, HTML).
   - Add localization support.

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Performance Issues**
   - Use efficient libraries for Markdown parsing and RTF conversion.
   - Profile the app to identify and resolve bottlenecks.

2. **Cross-Platform Challenges**
   - Focus on macOS initially and ensure the app adheres to macOS-specific guidelines.
   - Use a cross-platform framework to simplify future expansion.

3. **User Adoption**
   - Keep the app lightweight and focused on core functionality.
   - Provide a polished and intuitive user experience.
